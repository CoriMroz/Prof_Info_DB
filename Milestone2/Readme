A rundown of the included files:

1. ER Diagram - We used ERDPlus to create this diagram.  We feel confidant in it so far.  We also believe it matches up well with the Project Schema.

2. Database Schema - This has been the basis of all our work so far and it hasn't changed since we began our work.  That is susceptible to change.

3. Constraints - We do not have data for our database yet.  We have just been playing with small sets of dummy data.  Due to this fact, we have only vague constraints to date.

4. Front End Design - Provided is a mockup of our UI and sitemap for our Project.

5.  Relation Algebra Statements - Included are 5 fairly simple RA expressions.  We could not find a worthwhile online RA tool so we appologize for the hand written submission.
